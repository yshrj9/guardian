### How Our Project Finds the Solution

"GUARDIAN" is a one stop platform for students who want to manage their lives efficiently. It provides features which  manages deadlines, handles the budget and also helps in day to day chores. It allows them to balance their lives according to their choice by suggesting/reminding them about what's necessary for the future.

### Use Case

Our Platform Consists of three components 
######  1. Task Manager 
This component uses tickets to add tasks to the user's schedule with deadline and priority system. During the creation of a ticket, user can assign priorities according to him and it will  be queued in his/her timeline on the basis of colors which are assigned to different priorities.
######  2. Budget Manager
This component inputs user's data about their basic monthly expenses and their total pocket money, then suggests the best budget plan accordingly.
It also has a Edit Budget button which allows the user to make changes in the expenses at any time to alter their monthly expenditure plan which caters any need of urgent money used for a miscellaneous activity.
######  3. Daily Reminder
This component keeps tabs of basic chores, which a student has to perform, like medicines, exercise timings, birthday reminders etc. It sends a gentle reminder notification with a user desired note at the user's phone or desktop.
